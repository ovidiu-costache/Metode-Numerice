# Running the checker

## Through Docker

Use `./local.sh checker` to build the image and run the checker. This will take
some time (~700 secons). In order to build the image and get output, you can
do `./local.sh docker build` and then run the checker with `./local.sh checker`.

This is the environment used to automatically check your code.

## Manually

Go to the `checker` directory and run the `./checker.sh` script.
